Application (application.py)

  Input Interface :

    Model (model.py called from application.py) :

      Website interface that allows the user to choose between two input
      query options:

        1. Gene: Yeast Gene Name [or] Common ID (Single Query)(Ex. RAF1 or R0030W)
        2. Sequence: User specific sequence (Ex. AATGCAAAAATTGAAATCAA . . .)

      The model requires input for Sequence if the Gene entry is left blank, and
      the Gene query is required if Sequence is left blank. Additionally if the
      Gene text box is filled upstream and downstream buffers are required. Those
      buffer current default to 100 and 500 respectively. The values of the user
      inputs are then saved to variables in application.py

      HTML (query.html called from application.py) :

        HTML the builds a very simple web interface that contain four input
        boxes (Gene, Sequence, Upstream Buffer and Downstream Buffer), short
        descriptions of each query, and a submit button.


      Improvements: Have fields reset after inputs are submitted. This could
      be accomplished by just redirecting to the plotting page after submission.
